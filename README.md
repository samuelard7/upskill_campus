Password Generator

-> It has two levels of pass generation easy and hard.

-> Easy Level has a fixed order of [letters->numbers->symbols]

-> But in Hard mixed order of symbols with numbers and alphabets makes an extremely hard password. 

-> Usage of the random module for randomly choosing and shuffling and the os module for pausing the screen.
